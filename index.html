                    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                    <p>We are a boyfriend, girlfriend team located in Louisville, KY. We specialize in 3D printed home decor items, including planters, cake toppers, wedding table decor, and sometimes broken parts that need replacing. 3D printing allows for us to create quality, custom products that you most likely won’t find in stores. If you have an idea and want to see it printed, we can design & print almost any item you have in mind! </p>

                    <h2>How does 3D printing work</h2>
                    <p>3D Printing is a process which lays down very small layers of plastic, one by one, to create virtually any object. It’s a very slow process when high print quality is desired; each layer is only about 1-2 human hairs tall. Due to the nature of this process, there may be minor imperfections that can easily be fixed if you decide to finish it into a showpiece. </p>
    <p>
Can be used for protyping objects before larger projects are completed. There are many resources out there that can help make 3D printing easy to understand.
