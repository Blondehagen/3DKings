# 3DKings
Site built for my 3D printing shop.
Wanted to create a site for my boyfriends 3 D printing hobby.

Am hoping to later connect this site to an ETSY seller site where we will list and sell our 3D printed items.

<ol>I also added the following interactive features:
</li>A form on the Main page to have visitors tell us what items they would like to see printed.</li>
</li>A drop-down navigation bar</li>
  </ol>
